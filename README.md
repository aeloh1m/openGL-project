## Features

- Basic OpenGL setup
- Camera movement with mouse control
- Simple shaders and rendering setup
- Environment for further game development

## Prerequisites

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - Library for creating windows and handling input.
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) - OpenGL loader library.
- [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) - Mathematics library for OpenGL.
- **GCC ARM 34** - Required for compiling the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openGL-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd openGL-project
    ```
3. Build the project using GCC ARM 34:
    ```bash
    ./runTest.bat
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the executable:
    ```bash
